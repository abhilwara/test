Squad project delivery:

Worked extensively to deliver the OB ANZx project single handed. Being the only FTE, took full responsibility & ownership from end to end. Driving each activity from planning to execution.The scope spanned from understanding project visions, collating business requirements, chartering out clear execution plan to deliver specific integration solutions.
Highlights:

- Being the only member in the OB ANZx squad with prior knowledge of Open Banking, I was tasked with delivering 14 OB APIs. 
- Inspite of vendor resources being allocated, they were new to the MU framework, GCP and OB. Ensured continuous training and mentoring of new team members inspite of high churn rates, bringing everyone to speed and ensuring impactless deliveries.
- Led all design and mapping related discussions.
- Reviewed each and every PR extensively to minimise defects leaking into production.
- Mu framework modification

Supporting Chapter / Squad project delivery

Took the initiative in taking additional responsibility of leading the OB Classic Prometheus squad besides OB ANZx Surya squad.
- Lead all design discussions
- Drive the Sprint planning sessions taking into account the Release vision and goals.

There will always be a question as to what have you done other than project work, but the very fact that the project was delivered so smoothly without any issues speaks of where all the time went. 

The other option was to deliver half baked solution and then steal the limelight by fixing them later.
